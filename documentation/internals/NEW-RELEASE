The following steps describe how a new PartKeepr release is being built:

* Create a new GIT tag using:
  
  git tag -s <version>
  
  The tag message should contain a non-verbose list of changes. To view all commits since the last release, use:
  
  git log <previoustag>..HEAD
  

* Push the tag to the repository using:

  git push --tags
  

* Run the release script on the PartKeepr server:

  partkeepr-release.sh <tag>
  
  This generates a release and puts both tbz2 and zip archives into the downloads directory
  

* Test the archive for errors (simple installation should work)

* Update the downloads page

* Update the version table

* Write a blog entry

* Push out notifications on twitter

* Change irc topic to reflect the current version
