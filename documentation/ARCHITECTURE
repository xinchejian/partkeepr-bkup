PartKeepr is based on current technologies.

PHP
===

On the PHP side, we use namespaces as well as the following 3rd-party projects:

* Doctrine2 as ORM
* ImageMagick for image converting

All functionality is encapsulated in service calls, which are primarly used with the ExtJS frontend, but you can also
use these calls to implement your own automation / html-only frontend (see below).

JavaScript
==========

On the frontend side, we use ExtJS as GUI.

HTML-only frontend
==================

Although we currently don't have a plain HTML frontend, it can be added since we use a service architecture.
