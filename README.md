What is PartKeepr?
----------------

PartKeepr is an electronic part inventory management software. It helps you to keep track of your available parts and
assist you with re-ordering parts. PartKeepr is designed for hackerspaces with multiple users, but you can also use it
to manage your personal electronic part inventory.

Thanks
------

A very big "thank you" goes out to Georgyo of NYC resistor - although he claimed that he isn't creative, he invented the
name "PartKeepr" which eventually became the project's name.
