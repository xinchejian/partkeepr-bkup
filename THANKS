Big thanks goes out to (in no specific order):

* All members of the RaumZeitLabor crew, especially DaFo, nessi, sur5r and tiefpunkt for providing suggestions, testing
  and warm words for PartKeepr development.

* Mark James and Yusuke Kamiyamane for their brilliant icon sets

* Sencha for their brilliant ExtJS framework, without them it wouldn't have been possible to create this project

* The developers of DoctrineORM for their brilliant ORM; this really pushes PHP to be a serious development environment
